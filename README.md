## Course description

Over the past decades, growing debates and concerns have emerged about whether we are witnessing a period of democratic decline. These discussions have intensified in recent years, with renewed geopolitical tensions and events such as Donald Trump’s re-election and the rise of the European far right reigniting worries about the stability and resilience of democratic systems. In this context, this course explores the politics of democratic backsliding. It begins by reviewing key theories of democracy and democratic backsliding—understood as processes of state-led democratic erosion—before turning to the potential mechanisms behind these developments. The course first examines backsliding from the perspective of political elites, and then from that of citizens. Finally, it assesses recent trends and debates and concludes with a discussion on the current state of democracy. The aim of the course is to equip students with the conceptual tools to assess democracy and its potential erosion in today’s context, and to engage critically with the latest empirical research at the intersection of democratic theory and political behavior.

## Course organization

This course is organized as a block seminar that will run during the Spring term of 2026. Each block will consist of three or four sessions held on Fridays. The first block provides an overview of theories of democracy, democratic backsliding, and erosion. The second and third blocks then examine the mechanisms sustaining backsliding in today’s societies, focusing on the roles of political elites and citizens in Blocks II and III, respectively. The fourth and final block assesses current trends and debates on the measurement of, and resistance to, democratic backsliding. Students will give at least one presentation in one of the sessions in Blocks II, III, or IV. There will be no student presentations during Block I.

## Enrolment requirements

This course is open to advanced bachelor’s and master’s students interested in democracy and political behavior. Ideally, students should have some basic familiarity with core topics in political science. Since many of the assigned papers include statistical analyses and experimental designs, a basic understanding of statistics (descriptive statistics and regression) is **strongly recommended**.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **[Knowledge]** Understand key theories of democracy and democratic erosion, and assess major threats, trends, and forms of resilience.

2. **[Competence — Critical reading]** Critically evaluate quantitative research on democracy and political behavior, assessing theory and empirical strategy.

3. **[Competence — Writing]** Write critical response papers on scientific articles related to democracy and political behavior.

4. **[Competence — Communication]** Debate with their colleagues and communicate complex concepts effectively to a broad audience.

## Teaching policy

This course is designed as a seminar in which students are expected to complete the mandatory readings in advance and participate actively during class. Each session consists of two parts. In the first part, the lecturer will introduce the topic based on the readings. In the second part, students will present a case study of a country experiencing democratic backsliding (Blocks II, III, and IV) or take part in a group activity designed to encourage critical thinking (Block I). **Active participation is essential to the success of the course.**

## Integration and interaction policy

Discrimination due to race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation is strictly forbidden in this course. Students are encouraged to use inclusive language and to respect the sexual and gender identification of others. During each session, the lecturer will actively promote equal participation within the class. More generally, interventions must be carried out respectfully, integrating and engaging with different views and perspectives. Discouraging language or other bullying strategies are strictly forbidden, too.

## Artificial intelligence (AI) policy

The use of generative AI tools for preparing class materials is allowed. However, these tools should augment, not replace, human effort (e.g., students should not copy and paste content directly from these tools). The primary concern is not grades but the quality of class discussions, which are central to evaluation. Relying on AI to substitute for human work will hinder meaningful discussion and, ultimately, not only the grade but the learning outcomes. 

To help enforcing this policy, students are required to declare the use of AI and specify its scope in an appendix when submitting response papers, presentation slides or any other assignments.

## Evaluation

### Mandatory requirements (3 credits)

To receive the credits, students are expected to fulfill the following criteria:

#### 1. Attend all the sessions

Attendance is mandatory. Students can miss a maximum of two sessions. Missing more sessions without a justified certificate of absence implies failing the course.

#### 2. Do the mandatory readings before each session

This course is reading-intensive. Therefore, I recommend *reading cleverly*. For that:

  1. Read the the following blog entry: [How to Read a Scientific Article](https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-read) 

  2. Follow its advice!
  
  3. Do not hesitate to reach out the lecturer with any doubts or questions.

The reading texts will be uploaded to the materials folder in OLAT by the beginning of the course.

#### 3. Participate actively

Active engagement involves intervening during the discussion with questions, comments and ideas, reflecting on the content of the readings. Students are always encouraged to raise new arguments and debates.

#### 4. Write two response papers

Students must select two sessions from blocks II, III and IV. For each selected session, they must submit one short response paper (500–700 words).The selected sessions must come from different blocks (e.g., one from Block II and one from Block III), and not belong to the same block as the student’s presentation session.

The response papers should focus on one of the mandatory readings, however, students will benefit from linking them with ideas from additional readings.

A good response paper should:

  - *Start with a short summary of the paper*. It should not be a summary of the content but of the main argument and findings.
  
  - *Identify the contribution.* It should state clearly what bigger problem or question the author is contributing to addressing.
  
  - *Evaluate the argument from a critical perspective.* It should identify the main limitations of the paper and propose ways in which these limitations should be addressed either by the author or in future research.
  
Some strategies for critical reading can be found in this blog entry: [How to Critique a Scientific Article](https://macartan.github.io/teaching/how-to-critique). Follow its advice, and do not hesitate to reach out the lecturer with any doubts or questions.

The **submission rules** are:

- Students must upload their response papers to the *Response papers* folder in OLAT. 

- The deadline for submitting the response paper is at least one week before the corresponding session, that is, the **previous Friday at noon (12:00)**. 

- The file must be in Word. The title should include the session's number followed by the student's surname in capital letters and the response paper number (either 1 or 2). For example: *session05_CANALEJO_1*.

#### 5. Present a case study of a country under democratic backsliding 

Students will present a case study of a country experiencing democratic backsliding. Presentations will be conducted individually or in pairs and will last **a maximum of 30 minutes**. Case study countries will be **assigned during Block I**.

The objective of the presentation is to analyze democratic backsliding in a concrete national context, combining empirical evidence, institutional analysis, and critical discussion.

##### Structure of the presentation

Presentations should be organized around the following four components:

1. **Country background** ***(max. 10 minutes)***

Introduce the country by providing essential contextual information, including:


- Basic socio-economic and geopolitical context
- Democratic history (since when the country is considered democratic and to what extent)
- Type of democratic system (e.g. presidential or parliamentary; proportional or majoritarian)
- Structure of the party system


2. **Democratic backsliding and trends over time** ***(max. 10 minutes)***

Analyze democratic developments using empirical evidence, including:


- Data sources measuring democracy over time
- When and why the country is considered to be undergoing democratic backsliding
- Comparison with neighboring countries
- Main dimensions affected (e.g. elections, rule of law, media freedom, checks and balances)
- Key milestones, critical events, and the current situation


3. **Opposition, resilience, and future prospects** ***(max. 10 minutes)***

Discuss political dynamics and possible trajectories, including:


- Whether and how democratic backsliding is politicized
- Organization and strategies of opposition forces
- Forms of resistance and institutional or societal resilience
- Plausible scenarios for democratic recovery, continued erosion, or democratic breakdown


4. **Discussion question**

Conclude with one clear question to open a class discussion. This may involve:


- Evaluating specific developments in the case
- Comparing the country with others studied in the course
- Discussing alternative strategies or responses
- Normative or analytical reflections


Creativity is encouraged, as long as the question is clearly connected to the case.

##### Case study countries

- 40% of the grade is determined by the response papers.

- 50% of the grade is determined by the presentation.

The grade will not only take differences between students into account but also within students' differences over time (i.e., their personal progress).


### Seminar paper (4/6 credits)

Students can choose to write a *haupt* (master) seminar paper to obtain four (six) extra credits. The seminar paper must have between 6000 and 10000 words. The topic should be agreed upon between the instructor and the student. To this end, students are asked to write a paper outline of 1-2 pages consisting of the following elements:

-	Introduction of the topic

-	Research question

- Academic and societal relevance

-	Theory and tentative hypotheses

-	Approach and structure of the paper (including a tentative empirical design)

The deadline for the submission of the paper outline is **May 1st 2026**.

An approximate deadline for the submission of the seminar paper is **September 1st 2026**.
